        <h2>Yellow Rice</h2>
        <img src="My/1YRice.jpeg" alt="Finished Dish">
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p> 
            2 cups long-grain rice (such as Basmati)
            1 tablespoon vegetable oil or butter
            1 small onion, finely chopped
            2 cloves garlic, minced
            1 teaspoon ground turmeric
            1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
            1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
            4 cups chicken or vegetable broth (or water)
            Salt to taste
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>    Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain the rice and set it aside.

            In a large saucepan or pot, heat the vegetable oil or melt the butter over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and saut√© until it becomes soft and translucent.
        
            Add the minced garlic to the pot and cook for another minute, stirring constantly to avoid burning.
        
            Stir in the ground turmeric, ground cumin, and ground coriander. Cook the spices with the onions and garlic for about a minute to release their flavors, creating a fragrant base for the rice.
        
            Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir it well, ensuring the rice grains are coated with the spiced onion mixture.
        
            Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth (or water) into the pot. If using saffron, add the saffron threads along with the soaking liquid to the rice mixture. Season with salt to taste.
        
            Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and let the rice simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed, and the rice is cooked through.
        
            Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 5-10 minutes to allow the steam to finish cooking the rice and for flavors to meld.
        
            Fluff the yellow rice with a fork before serving.</p>
