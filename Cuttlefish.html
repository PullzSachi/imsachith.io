        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            2 medium-sized cuttlefish (cleaned, washed, and sliced)
            2 tablespoons olive oil
            3 cloves garlic (minced)
            1 onion (finely chopped)
            1 red bell pepper (sliced)
            1 green bell pepper (sliced)
            1 tomato (diced)
            1 teaspoon paprika
            1 teaspoon dried oregano
            Salt and pepper to taste
            Fresh parsley (chopped, for garnish)
            Lemon wedges (for serving)
        </p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            Prepare the Cuttlefish: Ensure the cuttlefish are cleaned thoroughly. Remove the head, cartilage, and innards. Cut the body into rings or slices, or as desired.

            Sauté Onion and Garlic: Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet or pan over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until the onion becomes translucent and the garlic is fragrant.
        
            Add Vegetables: Add the sliced red and green bell peppers to the pan. Sauté for a few minutes until they start to soften.
        
            Incorporate Cuttlefish: Add the sliced cuttlefish to the skillet with the sautéed vegetables. Cook for about 5-7 minutes or until the cuttlefish turns opaque and tender.
        
            Seasoning: Stir in the diced tomato, paprika, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Mix everything together well, allowing the flavors to combine and the tomatoes to soften.
        
            Simmer: Reduce the heat to low and let the cuttlefish mixture simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes. Ensure the cuttlefish is cooked through but not overcooked to maintain its tenderness.
        
            Garnish and Serve: Once done, garnish the cuttlefish with freshly chopped parsley. Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the cuttlefish just before eating.</p>
