        <img src="My/2SFood.jpeg" alt="Finished Dish">
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>    2 cups long-grain rice (such as Basmati)</p>
            <p1>1 tablespoon vegetable oil or butter
            1 small onion, finely chopped
            2 cloves garlic, minced
            1 teaspoon ground turmeric
            1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
            1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
            4 cups chicken or vegetable broth (or water)
            Salt to taste
            Optional: a pinch of saffron threads for added color and flavor (soaked in a tablespoon of warm water for a few minutes before using)</p1>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            Prepare the Shrimp: Ensure the shrimp are peeled and deveined. Pat them dry with paper towels and season lightly with salt and black pepper.

            Melt Butter: In a large skillet or frying pan, melt 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium heat.
        
            Sauté Garlic: Add 4 cloves of minced garlic to the melted butter. You can also add 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes at this point if you want a hint of spice. Sauté the garlic for about 1 minute until fragrant, being careful not to let it burn.
        
            Cook Shrimp: Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the seasoned shrimp to the skillet in a single layer, allowing them to cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side until they turn pink and opaque. Avoid overcrowding the pan; cook the shrimp in batches if needed.
        
            Season and Garnish: Season the cooked shrimp with additional salt and pepper if necessary. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley over the shrimp for added flavor and presentation.
        
            Serve: Transfer the garlic butter shrimp to a serving dish. Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the shrimp just before eating.
